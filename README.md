**This library is in very nascent stage and should NOT be used.**

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, 
`husk` will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
